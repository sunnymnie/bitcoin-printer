# Bitcoin Printer 

## Immediate tasks:
- create `data_analysis.py` that has the following methods: 
    - `plot_corr_matrix()`
    - Consider making one for plotting simple plots, but may not need this. 
    
## Project goal: 
Create a Scikit-learn model that can reliably predict bitcoin dips

Also, emoji meanings: 
- ✅ Finished satisfactorily 
- 🟡 Finished, but might want to double check and perhaps re-do
- 🔴 Finished haphazardly, needs major make-over. (ie, for brainstorming sessions)
- ⬜ Todo
- ⭐ Currently working on 

## Project timeline:
1. ✅ Download past Bitcoin data
2. ✅ Create basic technical indicators
3. 🟡 Create target column
4. ⬜ Optimizing and exploring paramaters / features
5. ⬜ Finding best hyperparamaters of model and weeding out features with low feature importance. 
6. Testing best representation of data for model. 
    1. Many classification models or just one? 
    2. Create concrete decision which features to keep and which to remove. 
7. Create new model(s) for predicting local bitcoin peaks. 
    1. Re-create target column and basic technical indicators
    2. Use test with a variety of features, and include all selected features used for bitcoin dip model. 
    3. Re-consider how many models to use
8. Create program that takes in bitcoin prices hourly and runs them by the models. Create UI and host model to run 24/7 with api-access to buy and sell on Binance. 
9. Foward testing with small amounts of money. If unsuccessful consider if problem stems from model or from model-wrapper. Else, turn on bitcoin printer. 
10. Expansion: predict stocks, altcoins, commodities, etc. 

**Sidequests (Optional, consider doing when reaching chokepoint)**
- Look into incorporating fundamental data / indicators
- Try to incorporate traditional technical patterns (triangle, support and resistance)
- Use TensorFlow (recommended after 9)

### Miscellaneous notes (remove if becomes useless)
- Indicator inspiration
    - bull flag. up then slight pullback with decrease in selling volume. if selling is high = price correction. 
        - pole starts as dip in uptrend
        - usual gain: bottom of pole to top of pole distance
    - falling wedge: gain price = largest movement in price of wedge on leftest side
    - W and M patterns, w is bullish
    - fib retracement
    - btc dominance

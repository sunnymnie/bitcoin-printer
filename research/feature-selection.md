# Feature selection

Reduce input variables to (1) reduce computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, (2) to improve the performance of the model.

## Statistical-based feature selection
Evaluating the relationship between each input variable and the target variable using statistics and selecting those input variables that have the strongest relationship with the target variable. 

## Two main types of feature selection techniques
1. supervised 
    1. Wrapper
    2. Filter
    3. Intrinsic
2. unsupervised

## Filter-based feature selection 
Use statistical measures to score the correlation between input variables that can be filtered to choose the most relevant features.

## Statistical measures for feature selection 
Carefully chosen based on the data type of the input variable and the output or response variable.
